In Objective-C, a rare but perplexing issue can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management, specifically when dealing with weak references. If an observer is using a weak reference to the observed object and that observed object is deallocated while the observer is still active, the observer might attempt to access a deallocated object, leading to a crash. This is less common with strong references since the observer will keep the observed object alive until it is deallocated. 

Example:

```objectivec
@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) MyObservedObject *observedObject;
@end

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // Accessing observedObject here after it might have been deallocated
    if (self.observedObject) { //Check for nil before use
        NSLog(@
