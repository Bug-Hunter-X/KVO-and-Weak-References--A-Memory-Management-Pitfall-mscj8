# Objective-C KVO and Weak References: A Memory Management Pitfall

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and weak references.  When an observer holds a weak reference to the observed object, and that object is deallocated while the observer is still active, accessing properties of the observed object can lead to crashes.

## The Bug

The `bug.m` file contains code that illustrates the problem.  A weak reference to the observed object (`MyObservedObject`) is used by the observer (`MyObserver`). When the observed object is deallocated, the weak reference becomes nil. However, if the observer hasn't yet removed itself as an observer and attempts to access the observed object after deallocation, a crash will occur.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version. The solution involves adding a check for nil before accessing the observed object within the `observeValueForKeyPath` method, effectively preventing attempts to access deallocated memory.   This ensures that the observer handles the case where the observed object has already been released.   Proper removal of the observer using `removeObserver:` is also essential to prevent these issues.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Run the application.  Observe the crashes in the original buggy version and the successful execution in the corrected version.

## Lessons Learned

This example highlights the importance of careful memory management when using KVO with weak references in Objective-C.  Always check for nil before accessing the observed object and ensure timely removal of observers to avoid unexpected crashes.
